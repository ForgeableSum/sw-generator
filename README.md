# Star Wars Movie Generator
 
Generates a random Star Wars movie title, episode number and prologue screen opening crawl with some funny music. 

sw-generator uses the moby thesaurus, as well as some lexiconic / semantic trickery to generate titles and prolouge text that sounds very Star Wars-y.  

I have no idea why I made this...
